Implementations in this folder are to show the Frontend of Parrot. They are not meant to be used in real applications but rather to show our Frontend has the same expressive power as the ordinary LLM-Agent development framework.

The functions are imported from `semantic_code_lib/app/`.

We don't bench these applications.
